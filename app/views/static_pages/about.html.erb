      <h3>About NUSGhoss</h3>
      <p>
        Having lecture theatres and seminar rooms which can allocate more than 100 students, it is not possible to recognize all students,
        taking the same module or listening to the same set of lecture. There is almost no communication among them, and where there is,
        it is with people whom are already known of or become buddies. Students tend to move around in their own groups in the campus.
      </p><p>
        Besides, due to random allocation from tutorial balloting or short duration of tutorial lessons, sometimes,
        despite attending the same tutorial class over the whole semester, not all classmates become acquaintances to students.
        Within the school, within the course, or even among the students taking the same module,
        the social circle of students remains very limited.
      </p><p>
        In order to overcome this issue, NUS Ghoss (NUS Ghost Gossip) would provide a platform to share fun and interesting stories about school mates,
        lecturers, tutors, or school related topics on modules and facilities. Users can develop familiarity with other users by going
        through the posts about them, and even can discover new friends. With anonymity, users can speak up their thoughts, views,
        opinions without a burden. Ultimately, the app aims to bring togetherness for NUS students and staffs.
